## What is it

Technical Debt Dataset  is a curated dataset containing measurement data from four tools executed on all commits to enable researchers to work on a common set of data and thus compare their results.

The dataset was built by extracting the projects' data and analyzing all the comments it using several tools. To get the data, the projects' GitHub repositories were cloned, commit information was collected from the git log using PyDriller, and fault information was obtained by extracting issues from the Jira issue tracker. After that, code quality was inspected using two tools: Technical Debt items were analyzed with SonarQube, and code smells~\cite{Fowler1999} and anti-patterns~\cite{BrownAntipatterns} with Ptidej~\cite{Ptidej}. In addition, the fault-inducing and -fixing commits were identified by applying our implementation~\cite{OpenSZZ} of the SZZ algorithm~\cite{SZZLiterature}.
